# MyMovieDB
Personal movie database


As a film enthusiast, I want to be able to find new movies to watch based 
on the movies I have seen and create a “watch List’ from my search

Acceptance Criteria:

If I view the webpage
Then I am asked to input a movie name and search criteria
The search criteria include actor name input field, genre dropdown menu and decade of release dropdown menu

When I view the webpage, there is a list of past searches displayed below the input fields
When I input criteria, I am presented with a list of movies that satisfy those criteria
Movies are listed with latest at top
If no criteria is chosen, return list of movies from same genre as inputted movie name
When I view the returned list, I can see the movie poster, name, year of release and genre
When I click on a list item I am presented with the movie details + embedded link to YouTube trailer 
If I want to add a movie to my watch list, I can click on provided button to add it to my ’watch list’
When I click on “Watch list” tab in the navigation bar, I am directed to page with list of movies I want to watch
When I view the list, I can click a checkbox for movies I have watched or delete movies I no longer want to watch
